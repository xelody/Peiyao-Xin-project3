# Project 3 - Password Manager

## Write-up
1. What were some challenges you faced while making this app?<br />
      Ensuring the frontend and backend components of the application were smoothly integrated was challenging. This involved designing RESTful APIs, handling HTTP requests/responses, and managing state effectively in the frontend. Additionally, since validating user input and handling errors gracefully were important aspects of building a robust application, implementing client-side and server-side validation, as well as displaying meaningful error messages to users, required a lot of efforts.

2. Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?<br />
      I believe an important feature to have is Multi-factor Authentication given the sensitivity of information that this app has. Implementing MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using methods such as SMS codes, email verification, or authentication app. Moreover, I think a password strength meter would also be useful during password creation by providing real-time feedback on the strength of the password.

3. What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?<br />
    I assumed that the user knows the username that he/she want to share the password with. I assumed that the backend API endpoints should follow RESTful principles, providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user accounts and passwords.

4. How long did this assignment take to complete?<br />
    It took me about ~24 hours to complete this project.
